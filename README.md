# reviews-next

This is re-imagination of the reviews app used by nilenso. 

### Primary goals
- Reviews are stored as human readable files
- We should be able to create arbitrary review events
- It should be easy to read and write reviews
- One should be able to run analytics over the reviews/levels
- Allow external users to review
- Data is backed up in a git repository
